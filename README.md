** # Overview **
This is my LaunchCode LiftOff Project Assignment Repository. This is an application that I am working on developing currently.

My project will be an all-in-one place to enter receipts and purchases along with the supplier/vendor details.  It will be an online database that users login to in order to gain access to their stored information.  There is also a pricing calculator that is available for use by the artists/retailer for completed works and figuring out the formula for pricing pieces of art and will also allow tracking those pieces.  
The project was motivated by me, being an Artist/Retailer I need an assistant or at least a convenient all in one place to enter important information that pertains to my work. I have very little to no time at all to waste and having information entered and stored on any device that I can retrieve later and filter really makes it easier to do and to use. I am working on developing that one stop application that you can get into a routine with and that you’ll utilize more than you know.

__ ## Features __
* As an Artist/Retailer you will go to my site and create a login with a unique user Id and password. You are then asked to create a profile and include photos of your work and some additional information.

** Now for the application features **

* Receipts and Purchase Database: After every business purchase you make, enter the details from the receipt and add a photo of the receipt for later reference.

* Receipt Information also retains the Vendor/Dealer information which then triggers a Vendor/Dealer page to be created if it doesn’t already exist under your user Id. You can add details about your contact at that company and any notes to remember for the next interaction.

* Pricing Calculator: Upon completion of a piece of work, the materials used can be filtered from the purchases database into a pricing calculator or pricing formula, depending on your medium/genre, designed in the app to show both retail and wholesale suggested prices. For now, it will be set for primarily Jewelry Designers - silversmiths.

* Inventory of work: As prices are created using this application a new-piece-of-work page is created every time. Each piece that you entered information for will trigger that new page to capture information and then you can upload a photo of the piece as well. You should also be able to see available pieces as inventory items in a spreadsheet format.

With this application you will be able to stay on top of a large portion of the time consuming busy work of filing papers and calculating financials and begin to have a little extra time and peace of mind. Now with this mobile database application you are doing it the easy way like entering in purchases and figuring out things for each piece of work like, what it costs me to make and what price I need to sell each piece at in order to make a living.
It really should be that simple.

**### Technologies**
* Java
* Spring Boot
* MySQL
* Thymeleaf templates
* Bootstrap

**#### What I'll have to learn**
For the login and creating a unique user id and password I will have to know how to check against pre-existing information in the database and storing that information encryptped and authenticating it when used.  I will be utilitzing MySQL database for only the second time.  This project will also have to link up with an excel spreadsheet while CSS will provides a prettier image.  and maybe for later, I plan to add other features later like a more focused inventory tracking system with upload photos feature of work, add descriptions, and that brings in pricing to assist with online sales and website maintenance.
